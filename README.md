# Numerical-methods-HPC-Aspects

This is a repo for sharing ideas/codes/demo's related to Numerical Methods used in CFD, FEA, DL, ML and/or its HPC aspects, with a purpose of academic, professional
or lesiure satisfaction.
Be organized !!!

## A perspective on Numerical Methods used in CFD, FEA, ML, and DL these days
A lot depends on how we approximate differential operators or calculate gradients 
in these numerical methods. To put it succinctly, we have not been taught well how to 
approximate these differential operators properly. If one keeps up with major ways 
of approximating differential operators are by following way, 
- **Automatic differentiation** (used in automatic differentiation Libraries like Tensorflow/PyTorch/Zygote
- **Numerical differentiation** (good old Taylor series, majorly used in CFD softwares) 
- **Symbolic differentiation** (used in Maple/Mathematica/Sage like Libraries) 

Of these, we have been exposed to numerical differentiation a lot times, but a 
bulk of us don't know how to create automatically stencils of linear operators and 
apply boundary conditions on them.

In coming weeks, a small demonstration/blog of these would be added to the repo, 
along with useful references
